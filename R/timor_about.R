# About Peskas

Peskas is a web portal displaying data and insights on the fisheries of Timor-Leste. It is the official fisheries national monitoring system of Timor-Leste.

Peskas relies on a team of Timorese enumerators collecting catch data from fishers around Timor-Leste. Catch data are matched with vessel tracking data to show fishing trends over time and space.

Peskas was built with the objectives of being low cost, open source, open access and near-real time.

Peskas is the result of an ongoing partnership between WorldFish and the Timor-Leste Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries' Department of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Marine Resources since 2016.

Peskas was made possible with the generous donations of The Royal Norwegian Embassy in Jakarta, The Minderoo Foundation, The CGIAR Big Data Platform and the Schmidt Foundation.

Peskas is funded by the Government of Timor-Leste since 2021 with technical support from WorldFish and Pelagic Data Systems Inc.

Information about the process and user-centred design of the Peskas pipeline and initial analytics, and its application in fisheries research & management can be found in the following publications:
