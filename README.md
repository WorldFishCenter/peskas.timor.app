A web portal displaying data and insights from small fisheries in East Timor. 

This app is structured as an R package and makes heavy use of the [golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) framework to organise the package. 
The user interface is heavily customised and relies on the open source dashboard template [tabler](https://tabler.io).

Reproducibility is managed by combining docker and renv. This app runs in Google Cloud Run.
